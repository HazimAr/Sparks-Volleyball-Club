          </span>{" "}
          Refunds of registration fees will be subject to an administrative fee,
          established annually by Sparks Volleyball Club. Registration fees
          shall be refunded when such requests are made prior to the first
          practice of the season. Refunds shall be for the full amount paid,
          minus the administrative fee.&nbsp;

            Refund Due to Injury:
          </span>{" "}
          Refunds due to injury prior to the first practice of the season shall
          be for the full amount when all Sparks provided uniforms and equipment
          have been returned to Sparks Volleyball Club. Refunds due to injury

            Tryout Fees Not Refunded
          </span>
          : Because tryout evaluations are conducted by paid coaches, Sparks
          Volleyball Club will not refund tryout fees.&nbsp;
        </p>

            Traveling Team Fees:
          </span>{" "}
          Sparks Volleyball Club traveling team fees are based on additional
          costs associated with playing in traveling tournaments, affiliated
          league fees (including required insurance and national association
          memberships) and additional uniform and equipment costs. Therefore,
          refunds for traveling team fees will be permitted only in certain
          circumstances which typically are beyond the member&rsquo;s control.
          Requests for refunds of traveling team fees must be made in writing to
          the Club Director for which the player is registered. The Club
          Director and Staff will determine if a refund is warranted within the
          following guidelines:
        </p>
        <p>
          &nbsp;a) In general, because of the up-front costs involved, no
          refunds will be permitted for an arbitrary withdrawal from a Sparks
          Volleyball Club traveling team.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          b) Refunds due to injury prior to the start of the season shall be for
          the full amount paid, less any tryout fees charged and less an
          administrative fee, provided all Sparks uniforms and equipment have
          been returned and proof of the player&rsquo;s inability to play have
          been demonstrated to the Club Director. Where proof of the
          player&rsquo;s inability to compete is not shown, refunds shall be
          determined by the Club Director and Staff.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          c) In cases where the player&rsquo;s family moves out of the Sparks
          Volleyball Club region (30 miles or more from usual practice location)
          or some other unforeseeable hardship arises, a refund shall be granted
          in the same manner as if the player had been injured.
        </p>
        <p>
          &nbsp;d) In cases where Sparks Volleyball Club does not field a
          traveling team at the level for which the player has registered, a
          full refund will be granted.
        </p>
        <p>
          &nbsp;e) The Club Director and Staff determine the time at which the
          traveling team fee is collected based on previous experience. In the
          event the traveling team fee is collected at registration and the
          player is not chosen for a Sparks Volleyball Club traveling team, the
          traveling team fee portion of the total fee will be refunded if the
          player joins another Sparks club team. If a player not chosen for a
          Sparks traveling team decides to leave the Sparks program, a full
          refund, less any tryout fee and administrative fee will be made.&nbsp;

            Appeal of Refund Amount:
          </span>{" "}
          Sparks members may request review and revision of refund amounts.
          Appeals must be presented in person to the Club Director prior to or
          during the season of play for which the refund is being considered.
          Upon consideration of such appeal, refund amounts shall be final. No
          appeals shall be considered where the initial refund check has been
          endorsed and deposited by the member and payment has been recorded to

        </p>
        <p>
          Sparks Volleyball Club philosophy is to &ldquo;Learn life lesson
          through the sport of volleyball.&rdquo; We provide opportunities for
          athletes to learn the game of volleyball as well as what it means to
          be a team player and learn to strive for excellence through
          sport.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Competitive team athletics, by its very nature, creates an environment
          where athletes, parents and/or coaches may not be in agreement with
          all decisions made. Knowing when and how to communicate with the coach
          or Club Director is a concern for almost every parent at some time
          during the season. Most often the concern is how to inquire about
          issues surrounding playing time.
        </p>
        <p>
          &nbsp;At Sparks Volleyball Club, the grievance process that athletes
          and parents must follow is based on many years of experience in this
          area.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Athletes are first encouraged to communicate with their coaches.
          Athletes are expected to discuss issues concerning playing time or any
          other volleyball related subject with their coaches first before
          escalation is needed. Parents are encouraged to communicate with the
          Club Director only after exhausting all the recourses to resolve the
          problem.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Coaches are instructed not to discuss coaching decisions with parents.
          These coaching decisions include but are not limited to playing time,
          substitution patterns, team line-up decisions, etc. Coaches are not
          required to defend his/her thought process or conclusions at any time
          during the season.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Coaches are instructed not to engage in controversial discussions
          during tournaments or practice. If a coach is approached during a
          tournament, he/she has been instructed to: refuse to discuss any
          controversial matter; to refer the parent to the Club Director and to
          walk away from the situation.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Parents and Athletes are asked to adhere to the following grievance
          process:&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          1. The Athlete meets with the coach to discuss the matter. If the
          matter is not resolved or the athlete has a reasonable concern about
          speaking to the coach, then...
        </p>
        <p>
          &nbsp;2. The parent meets with the Club Director. In certain
          situations, the Club Director may ask either the coach or athlete (or
          both) to attend the meeting.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          3. All decisions and recommendations by Sparks Volleyball Club and the
          Club Director are final and not subject to appeal.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The recommended time for a parent and/or athlete to meet with a coach
          is <span style={{ textDecoration: "underline" }}>24 hours</span> after
          a tournament and is best immediately after a scheduled practice.
          (Please schedule in advance) It is inappropriate for an athlete or a
          parent to approach other Sparks Volleyball Club members about a
          problem the athlete or a parent is having with a coach, about
          objections to coaching, or administrative decisions. For the
          psychological health of the teams and the Club as a whole, grievances
          must be handled via the Grievance process outline above.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Sparks Volleyball Club strongly promotes fairness and believes in open
          communication. All issues and concerns are immediately addressed with
          the athlete's well-being in mind.

            Sparks Volleyball Tolerance Policy
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          We expect each athlete, coach and parent to follow the Code of Conduct
          set up by the USA Volleyball program. The Code of conduct was signed
          electronically when signing up to be a USAV member. Our coaches have
          gone through IMPACT training at the bare minimum and are expected to
          follow those guidelines as well as the Club&rsquo;s guidelines.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Sparks Volleyball Club does not tolerate hostile, aggressive
          confrontations between a parent and any official, another parent, a
          coach, another athlete, or another team's representative (including
          coach, athlete or parent). Violation of this policy may result in the
          athlete being dismissed from Sparks Volleyball Club without
          refund.&nbsp;
